S-edit is a schematic entry tool that is used to document circuits that can be driven forward into a layout
of an integrated circuit. It also provides the ability to perform SPICE simulations of the circuits using a
simulation engine called T-SPICE. T-SPICE can be setup and invoked from with in S-edit.
