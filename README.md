# Tanner_Documentation
This is the documentation of Tanner EDA which I had undergone in CDAC,Noida.

Tanner EDA is a suite of tools for the design of IC's. These tools allow you to enter
schematics, perform SPICE simulations, do physical design (i.e., chip layout), and perform design rule
checks (DRC) and layout versus schematic (LVS) checks. There are 3 tools that are used for this process:
S-edit - a schematic capture tool
T-SPICE - the SPICE simulation engine integrated with S-edit
L-edit - the physical design tool
